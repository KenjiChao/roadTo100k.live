- Choose your best/featured video for maximum impact

### 4. Configure the Website

Open `script.js` and update the `CONFIG` object:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  YOUTUBE_API_KEY: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE",
  CHANNEL_ID: "UC_YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_HERE",
  FEATURED_VIDEO_ID: "YOUR_VIDEO_ID_HERE",
  CHANNEL_NAME: "Your Actual Channel Name", // Will be auto-updated from API
  TARGET_SUBSCRIBERS: 100000,
};
```

### 5. Customize Content

1. **Channel Name**: Update the `<h1 class="channel-name">` in `index.html`
